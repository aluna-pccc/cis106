    `sudo apache2ctl configtest` checks the apache configuration for syntax errors in the configuration or service.
    `sudo tail /var/log/apache2/error.log` this command prints the last few entries of the log file. Basically, it says, show me the las few lines that were written to the error log for Apache.
    `sudo systemctl restart apache2` stops and starts the apache service. Basically it clears processes or stops and reloads the service that is responsible for running apache. It resets state without restarting the whole server.

    `/var/log/apache2/access.log` stores all the requests processed by the server.
