# Ubuntu
**Ubuntu** is a *Linux* distribution based on *Debian* and composed mostly of free and open-source software. **Ubuntu** is officially released in multiple editions: ***Desktop, Server,  and Core***  for Internet of things devices and robots. The operating system is developed by the British company Canonical, and a community of other developers, under a meritocratic governance model. As of October 2023, the most-recent release is 23.10 *("Mantic Minotaur")*, and the current long-term support release is 22.04 *("Jammy Jellyfish")*.

As with other Linux distributions, all of the editions can run on a computer alone, or in a virtual machine. An upgrade to Ubuntu is released every six months, with long-term support (LTS) releases every two years. Canonical provides security updates and support for each Ubuntu release, starting from the release date until the release reaches its designated end-of-life (EOL) date.
