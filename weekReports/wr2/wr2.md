# Lecture 2 Introduction to Linux Notes

## Important concepts:
* **Operating System:**
  * An operating system provides all fundamental software features of a computer.
* **Kernel:**
  * An OS kernel is a software component that's responsible for managing low-level features of the computer, including the following managing system hardware, memory allocation, CPU time, and program to program interaction.
* **Components of an operating system:**
  * Applications
  * Graphical Desktop Interface or Environment
  * Daemons (services) and shells
  * Kernel
  * Libraries
   
* **Linux :**
  * Unix-like operating system developed by an open source community, which maintains it and develops software for it.  
* **Linux Characteristics:**
  * Free
  * Open Source
  * Highly Flexible
  * All Code is available to be reviewed by anyone and can be modified by anyone. 
  * Portable, can run on almost any hardware
  * Light 
  * Compartamentlized, you can install just what you need and keep out what you dong need. ie You cannot uninstall Internet Explorer from Windows. 
* **GNU Toolchain:**
  * A set of programming tools produced by the GNU Project to be used in the development of software and that are meant to be used serially. 
* **Linux Distribution:**
  * A distribution is a complete Linux package made of:
    * The kernel
    * Core Tools
    * Supplemental Software
    * Startup Scripts to setup the system or enviroment
    * An installer or packager to manage the installation of new packages/software updates, etc.
* **What is Ubuntu:**
  * Ubuntu is a Linux distribution based of the Debian Project. It was meant to be a more user friendly version of Linux. It has free and paid professional support available. It includes many open source applications that a regular user may need to start getting familiar with Linux.
* **Ubuntu Release cycles:**
  * <b> Regular or Non-LTS </b>
    * <i> Ships every 6 months and supported for 9 months </i>
  * <b> LTS </b>
    * <i> Ships every two even years and is supported for 5 years </i>
* **What is Debian:**
  * Is an all-volunteer organization dedicated to developing free software and promoting the ideals of the Free Software community. 
* **Different software licensing models (open source vs closed source):**
  * Open Source: the software may be distributed for a fee or free. The source code is distributed with the software.
  * Closed Source: the software is not distributed with the source code. The user is restricted from modifying the code.
* **The 4 Freedoms of Free Software:**
  * <i>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
  * The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
  * The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
  * The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this. </i>
* **Virtualization:**
  * Defined as creating a non physical version of something. Takes advantage of system resources to partition them and distribute to many OSes on the same hardware. 
* **Hypervisor and types:**
  * Type 1 (bare-metal hypervisor): this type runs directly on the hardware. Basically the OS for the physical machine
  * Type 2: an application that runs on top of an OS. The most commonly used in client-side.
* **VirtualBox:**
* Multi-platform product for virtualization. It is feature rich, high performance.
